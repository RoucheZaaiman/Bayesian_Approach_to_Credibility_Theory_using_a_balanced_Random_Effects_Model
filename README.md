# Bayesian_Approach_to_Credibility_Theory_using_a_balanced_Random_Effects_Model
In this project I use model-based prediction to predict the future claims of 9 insurance companies, with the purpose to determine a predicitve interval in which claims will fall during the 11th year with a 95% probability.  It is further shown that great scholars prefer and praised the usefulness of the Bayesian method in actuarial science, credibility theory as well as statistical analysis in general.  MATLAB was used to do all the coding.  The code is included in the document as an appendix.
